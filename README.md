pyastro
=======

What is it?
-----------
**pyastro** is a Python module providing various astronomical functions. Its
primary motivation was to calculate close approximations of right ascension,
declination, and distance at the current or other specified time for all of
the solar system planets (Pluto is still classified as a planet by this
module) and for the sun and the moon, when viewed from the earth. The module
also provides other ancilliary functions, including solving Kepler's
equation and determining the astrological sign (using the tropical system)
in which a given solar system body is or was in.

Who maintains it?

**pyastro** is written and maintained by Paul Griffiths.
